# Datadog Cloud Foundry Buildpack

This is a [decorator buildpack](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack/blob/master/README.md#decorators) for Cloud Foundry. It will install a Datadog DogStatsD binary in the container your app is running on. This only contains the DogStatsd components of Datadog Agent, which has limited overhead.

## Use

### Install the [Meta Buildpack](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack#how-to-install-the-meta-buildpack)
First, you will have to [install the Meta Buildpack](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack#how-to-install-the-meta-buildpack). This enables apps to use decorator buildpacks. Follow the instructions to get the buildpack and upload it if you don't already have it.

### Upload the Datadog Cloud Foundry Buildpack
Download the latest Datadog [build pack release](https://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack-latest.zip). After you download the zipfile, you will have to upload it to Cloud Foundry environment.

```shell
cf create-buildpack datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack.zip 99 --enable
```

### Configuration

#### Metric Collection

**Set an API Key in your environment to enable the buildpack**:

```shell
# set the environment variable
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_API_KEY $YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY
# restage the application to get it to pick up the new environment variable and use the buildpack
cf restage $YOUR_APP_NAME
```

#### Log Collection

To start collecting logs from your application in CloudFoundry, the agent contained in the buildpack needs to be activated and log collection enabled.

```
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME RUN_AGENT true
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_LOGS_ENABLED true
# Disable the Agent core checks to disable system metrics collection
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_ENABLE_CHECKS false
# restage the application to get it to pick up the new environment variable and use the buildpack
cf restage $YOUR_APP_NAME
```

By default, the Agent collects logs from `stdout`/`stderr` and listens to TCP port 10514.
It is possible to ask the Agent to listen on a different TCP port if you are streaming logs from your application in TCP.
To disable log collection from `stdout`/`stderr`, use the following configuration:

```
# override the TCP port
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_LOGS_CONFIG_TCP_FORWARD_PORT 10514
# disable log collection on stdout/stderr
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DISABLE_STD_LOG_COLLECTION true
```

### DogStatsD Away!
