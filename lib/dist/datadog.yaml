# If you need a proxy to connect to the Internet, provide it here (default:
# disabled). You can use the 'no_proxy' list to specify hosts that should bypass the
# proxy. These settings might impact your checks requests, please refer to the

# Setting this option to "yes" will tell the agent to skip validation of SSL/TLS certificates.
# This may be necessary if the agent is running behind a proxy. See this page for details:
# https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Proxy-Configuration#using-haproxy-as-a-proxy
# skip_ssl_validation: no

# Setting this option to "yes" will force the agent to only use TLS 1.2 when
# pushing data to the url specified in "dd_url".

# Force the hostname to whatever you want. (default: auto-detected)
# hostname: mymachine.mydomain

# Set the host's tags (optional)
# tags:
#   - mytag

# Configure which aggregated value to compute. Possible values are: min, max,
# median, avg, sum and count.

# The Agent runs workers in parallel to execute checks. By default the number
